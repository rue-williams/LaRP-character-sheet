    "description": "Dark brown eyes and a crooked smile might be the first things you notice about Kal. She stands at about 5'7\", with strawberry blonde hair that's either under a hat or has at least two different kinds of organic detritus in it. Her face is stained with dirt, grass, sweat and... probably a few freckles. She's physically sturdy and almost always in worn and dusty denim pants.",
